Additionally, BG1 affects the sensitivities of the plant to auxin and auxin transport inhibitors, suggesting that its expression levels can alter how rice plants respond to hormonal signals that regulate growth.\n\nIn young panicles, BG1 is preferentially expressed, highlighting its critical role during the early stages of grain development. This expression is vital for ensuring that the grains develop properly and achieve optimal size. Furthermore, overexpression of BG1 has been shown to lead to increased grain size, demonstrating its significant impact on grain development.\n\nFinally, the BG1 gene influences the grain phenotype, particularly in terms of size and how the grains respond to environmental signals.
